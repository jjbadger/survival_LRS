## Analysis overview

In this hierarchical Bayesian model fit in JAGS, we define lifetime and age class-specific provisioning performance *PP* and reproductive frequency *RF*, defined as the individual intercepts in regressions describing pup weaning mass and probability of breeding. These variables were determined for both lifetime performance and age-class specific performance, with age classes 0-14, 15-24, and 25+. They are then used as covariates in a Cormack-Jolly-Seber open population model to determine their effect on survival. To learn more about the specifics of the methods, please refer to the publication referenced in the main repository README. Most information is commented-out of the script, but any further questions email jjbadger@alaska.edu.
