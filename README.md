# Late life reproductive investment drives life history variation in a long-lived mammal 

## Overview
The data and code provided in this repository was used to analyze grey seal reproductive data to determine how reproductive performance affects survival. 



## Layout

The repository is split into seven main directories, many of which have subdirectories. This structure has been designed to be easily navigable by humans and computers alike, allowing for rapid location of specific files and instructions. Within each directory is a `README.md` file which summarizes the purpose of that directory as well as some examples where necessary. This structure may not be perfect for your intended us and may need to be modified. Each section is briefly described below. 

### **`experiments`** 
Where all of the experimental information lives, including any *executed* code. lives. This includes pipelines, scripts, and figure files. 
 * **`processing`**: Any code used to *transform* the data into another type should live here. This can include everything from parsing of text data, image segmentation/filtering, or simulations.
 * **`analysis`**: Any code to to *draw conclusions* from an experiment or data set. This may include regression, dimensionality reduction, or calculation of various quantities.
 * **`exploratory`**: A sandbox where you keep a record of your different approaches to transformation, interpretation, cleaning, or generation of data.
 * **`figures`**: Any code used to generate figures for your finished work, presentations, or for any other use.

### **`data`** 
All raw data collected from your experiments as well as copies of the transformed data from your processing code.
